## Annoyances on os x
Running Selenium, this dialog may constantly pop up:
`Do you want the application "Python.app" to accept incoming network connections?` 

Alas, this message won't go away even if you click Accept.

To remedy:

1. In Terminal, type `which python` and copy the path returned.
1. `sudo codesign -f -s - [YOUR_PYTHON_PATH]` #adds a signature to calm OS X down

If this doesnâ€™t work, you may first have to [disable SIP if you're running El Capitan](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34760163/how-to-allow-python-app-to-firewall-on-mac-os-x).
